# Digital-tripping
its a digital distribution board that works digitally insted mechanical tripping method

this is the initial version of digital-tripping the digital distribution board
main objectives of this project:
1. ditalize the prevailing DB
2. get readings of the current as well as the volatge levels 
3. digitally trip the MCB & RCCB in case of high load or low voltages
4. inidicates and inform to the user. 
5. get readings of current as well as the voltages for analitical purposes.
6. give feedback of power consumpution in the house for the electricity board.

hardware & ssofteare requirments:
1.microcontroller(esp8166-12e)
2.hall efect current mesuring sensor(acs578)
3.other electronic components
4.arduino IDE
5. libraries: https://github.com/rkoptev/ACS712-arduino and    https://github.com/muratdemirtas/ACS712-arduino-1
